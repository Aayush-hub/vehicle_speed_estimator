# Real Time Vehicle Detection, Tracking, and Speed Estimation

## Problem - Smart Movement tracking solution of People/Vehicles from Point A to point B üöóüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Solution- 

1) The smart system which can help in tracking of people, vehicles travelling from Point A to Point B. 

2) The solution encompass a mechanism by which law enforcement agencies can track if there is a deviation from a specific route, 
   the speed of the vehicles can also be detected.

3) This solution will ensure that vehicles do not cross a speed limit, so as to minimize accidents with animals, who cross the road, especially during monsoon.

### ADVANTAGES

1) The smart system which can help in tracking of people, vehicles travelling from Point A to Point B.

2 The solution encompass a mechanism by which law enforcement agencies can track if there is a deviation from a specific route, the speed of the vehicles can also    be detected.

3) This solution will ensure that vehicles do not cross a speed limit, so as to minimize accidents with animals, who cross the road, especially during monsoon.

4) For nighttime use (outside the scope of this tutorial), we may need infrared cameras and infrared lights and/or adjustments to our camera parameters.
